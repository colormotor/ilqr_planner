/**
    This package provides a C++ iLQR library that comes with its python bindings.
    It allows you to solve iLQR optimization problem on any robot as long as you
    provide an [URDF file](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials) describing the
    kinematics chain of the robot. For debugging purposes it also provide a 2D
    planar robots class that you can use. You can also apply a spatial
    transformation to compute robot task space information in the base frame of
    your choice (e.g. object frame).
